The little pocky sticks are thin, crispy, and the chocolate is smooth and delicious. They are very tasty, and a great snack at any time of the day(hehe!). I agree with someone else who said they would live off of pocky if they could. Who wouldn't? The stuff is delicious!",

It is a lot of fun dipping the breadsticks into the cream, as well as reading/looking at the messages or picture on each bread stick. However, I always ran out of cream before finishing the breadsticks. I wish the containers for cream were deeper. The packaging is deceiving and makes you think that the cream sections of the cup go all the way down!",
